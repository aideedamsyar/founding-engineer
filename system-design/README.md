# System Design

- [ ] Separation of concerns (frontend/backend split)
- [ ] Data flow clarity (client -> API -> DB)
- [ ] Scalability bottlenecks (e.g. joins on Supabase, auth limits)
- [ ] Queues / webhooks / background jobs (like email sending)
- [ ] Webhook validation (for Stripe, Clerk, etc.)
- [ ] Modular architecture (components, services, utils)
